# Dolphin TAS Editor Deluxe
 
Inspired by Lioncash's DTMEditor (https://github.com/lioncash/DTMEditor), and using a tweaked version of their file IO.

Dolphin TAS Editor Deluxe strives to offer a much more friendly interface for editing TAS movie files by adding key features missing from existing DTM editors.
Inserting, removing, and editing frames is a quick and simple task.
Users may also leave notes on any frames of the file for ease of navigation, to be stored in a file adjacent to the movie.
